**Referral Management System (Java | MVC | Singleton | Swing)**

A simple referral management system built using plain Java, following the MVC architecture and implementing the Singleton pattern for referral processing. 
The application uses Java Swing for its GUI and reads/writes data from text files (no databases or external libraries). 
This work is being done as a part of my Computer Software Architecture course, and should not be copied without permission.

**Features**

* MVC Structure — clean separation of Model, View, and Controller
* Singleton Pattern — used for the referral manager to ensure consistent data handling
* Java Swing GUI — user-friendly interface for loading and managing records
* File-Based Storage — loads patients, clinicians, appointments, and prescriptions from text files
* Referral Creation & Processing — supports generating referral details and saving them to files
* Prescription Handling — allows inserting new prescription records
